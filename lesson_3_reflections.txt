When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  When you are not at your normal workplace, and need to create something on the go, or at a
  different location. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	
	Incase you create something on GitHub that you don't want to keep in your local repository. If you have created a file or modified
	a file on the go, but you weren't sure to keep it or not, you don't want to automatically update everything to your local
	repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	Forks are when you take someone else's repository from GitHub, and clone it to yours on the GitHub server. It lets you modify
	the files for your own liking. Since it is kept on the GitHub server, it is not called cloning.	
	Clone is when you copy the repository locally. Branches are different paths for your
	files.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	Then you can review it offline, when you don't have access to the remote.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

	Would be harder because I would have to use google or dropbox, which doesn't detail all of the changes
	that are made in the files, and isn't able to merge changes, or request changes to be merged.
